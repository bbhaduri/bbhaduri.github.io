Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Humans have the remarkable ability of performing complex, dynamic movements to navigate their surroundings. I'm interested in using methods from deep learning, dynamical systems theory, and optimal control theory to model how the brain generates volitional behavior while incorporating sensory and task information. Additionally, I seek to understand how the neural circuits underlying behavior are able to generate movement that can generalize across various tasks. Using this information, we can improve state of the art Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) to help individuals with paralysis regain volitional control of their bodies. I'm extremely fortunate to have my graduate studies funded by the National Science Foundation's Graduate Research Fellowship.

Previously, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology. There, I spent 3 years with [Dr. Chethan Pandarinath](https://snel.ai/author/chethan-pandarinath-phd/) in the [Systems Neural Engineering Laboratory](https://snel.ai) learning about the world of clinical BCIs and neural dynamics modeling.
