  abstractNote={ Objective. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are state-of-the-art tools for modeling
    and decoding neural activity, but deploying them in closed-loop experiments with tight timing 
    constraints is challenging due to their limited support in existing real-time frameworks. Researchers 
    need a platform that fully supports high-level languages for running ANNs (e.g. Python and Julia) while 
    maintaining support for languages that are critical for low-latency data acquisition and processing 
    (e.g. C and C++). Approach. To address these needs, we introduce the Backend for Realtime Asynchronous 
    Neural Decoding (BRAND). BRAND comprises Linux processes, termed nodes, which communicate with each other 
    in a graph via streams of data. Its asynchronous design allows for acquisition, control, and analysis to 
    be executed in parallel on streams of data that may operate at different timescales. BRAND uses Redis, 
    an in-memory database, to send data between nodes, which enables fast inter-process communication and 
    supports 54 different programming languages. Thus, developers can easily deploy existing ANN models in 
    BRAND with minimal implementation changes. Main results. In our tests, BRAND achieved <600 microsecond 
    latency between processes when sending large quantities of data (1024 channels of 30 kHz neural data in 
    1 ms chunks). BRAND runs a brain-computer interface with a recurrent neural network (RNN) decoder with 
    less than 8 ms of latency from neural data input to decoder prediction. In a real-world demonstration of 
    the system, participant T11 in the BrainGate2 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00912041) 
    performed a standard cursor control task, in which 30 kHz signal processing, RNN decoding, task control, 
    and graphics were all executed in BRAND. This system also supports real-time inference with complex latent 
    variable models like Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems. Significance. By providing a framework 
    that is fast, modular, and language-agnostic, BRAND lowers the barriers to integrating the latest tools in 
    neuroscience and machine learning into closed-loop experiments.},
