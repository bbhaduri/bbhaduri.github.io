  abstractNote={Objective. Artificial neural networks (ANNs) are state-of-the-art tools for modeling
    and decoding neural activity, but deploying them in closed-loop experiments with tight timing 
    constraints is challenging due to their limited support in existing real-time frameworks. Researchers 
    need a platform that fully supports high-level languages for running ANNs (e.g. Python and Julia) while 
    maintaining support for languages that are critical for low-latency data acquisition and processing 
    (e.g. C and C++). Approach. To address these needs, we introduce the Backend for Realtime Asynchronous 
    Neural Decoding (BRAND). BRAND comprises Linux processes, termed nodes, which communicate with each other 
    in a graph via streams of data. Its asynchronous design allows for acquisition, control, and analysis to 
    be executed in parallel on streams of data that may operate at different timescales. BRAND uses Redis, 
    an in-memory database, to send data between nodes, which enables fast inter-process communication and 
    supports 54 different programming languages. Thus, developers can easily deploy existing ANN models in 
    BRAND with minimal implementation changes. Main results. In our tests, BRAND achieved <600 microsecond 
    latency between processes when sending large quantities of data (1024 channels of 30 kHz neural data in 
    1 ms chunks). BRAND runs a brain-computer interface with a recurrent neural network (RNN) decoder with 
    less than 8 ms of latency from neural data input to decoder prediction. In a real-world demonstration of 
    the system, participant T11 in the BrainGate2 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00912041) 
    performed a standard cursor control task, in which 30 kHz signal processing, RNN decoding, task control, 
    and graphics were all executed in BRAND. This system also supports real-time inference with complex latent 
    variable models like Latent Factor Analysis via Dynamical Systems. Significance. By providing a framework 
    that is fast, modular, and language-agnostic, BRAND lowers the barriers to integrating the latest tools in 
    neuroscience and machine learning into closed-loop experiments.},

# LFP LFADS paper

  title={Reducing power requirements for high-accuracy decoding in iBCIs}, 
  volume={21}, DOI={10.1088/1741-2552/ad88a4}, 
  abstractNote={Objective. Current intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) rely predominantly on threshold crossings 
    (spikes) for decoding neural activity into a control signal for an external device. Spiking data can yield high accuracy 
    online control during complex behaviors; however, its dependence on high-sampling-rate data collection can pose challenges.
    An alternative signal for iBCI decoding is the local field potential (LFP), a continuous-valued signal that can be acquired 
    simultaneously with spiking activity. However, LFPs are seldom used alone for online iBCI control as their decoding 
    performance has yet to achieve parity with spikes. Approach. Here, we present a strategy to improve the performance of 
    LFP-based decoders by first training a neural dynamics model to use LFPs to reconstruct the firing rates underlying spiking 
    data, and then decoding from the estimated rates. We test these models on previously-collected macaque data during center-out 
    and random-target reaching tasks as well as data collected from a human iBCI participant during attempted speech. Main results. 
    In all cases, training models from LFPs enables firing rate reconstruction with accuracy comparable to spiking-based dynamics 
    models. In addition, LFP-based dynamics models enable decoding performance exceeding that of LFPs alone and approaching that of 
    spiking-based models. In all applications except speech, LFP-based dynamics models also facilitate decoding accuracy exceeding 
    that of direct decoding from spikes. Significance. Because LFP-based dynamics models operate on lower bandwidth and with lower 
    sampling rate than spiking models, our findings indicate that iBCI devices can be designed to operate with lower power requirements 
    than devices dependent on recorded spiking activity, without sacrificing high-accuracy decoding.},
